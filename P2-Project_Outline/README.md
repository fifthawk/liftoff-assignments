## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My app will be a chat app/website for friends, co-workers, classmates, etc. Something that people will find useful is that the site will be clean and easy to use for all ages! The idea came to me from wanting something simple to use to chat with a friend while asking questions about coding. There are a lot of options out there, but I think there could be a lot added!

### Features

-User log in: User can log in with a username/id that can be viewed by others.
-Friends/Contacts List: User can log add friends/known usernames/ids to their friends list for easy access.
-Color pallette: User will be able to create their own user pallete for UI -- can be dark/light/other.

### Technologies

-Javascript
-React
-Websockets
-APIs

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn more about React and it's hooks, specifically. It is one of my favorite technologies to work with, so getting to learn more is always nice. I will also have quite a bit more to learn about websockets and how the conversations/usernames will be stored for the end user.
